                <p><strong>Customer Data </strong></p>
                <p>Customer Data is all the data, including all text, sound, software or image files that you provide, or are provided on your behalf, to us through your use of the Services. For example, Customer Data includes data that you upload for storage or processing in the Services and applications that you or your end users upload for hosting in the Services. It does not include configuration, technical settings, or support ticket information.</p>
                <p>We only use Customer Data to provide the Services. This may include troubleshooting aimed at preventing, detecting and repairing problems affecting the operation of the Services and the improvement of features that involve the detection of, and protection against, emerging and evolving threats to the user (such as malware or spam).</p>
                <p>Customer Data will be stored only in datacenters located in China. In limited circumstances, 21Vianet may authorize one of its affiliates, suppliers or subcontractors located outside China to access Customer Data when necessary to troubleshoot customer support incidents or resolve technical issues. 21Vianet will supervise such access and terminate the access when the issue is resolved.</p>
                <p><strong>Administrator Data</strong></p>
                <p>Administrator Data is the information about administrators (including account contact and subscription administrators) provided during sign-up, purchase, or administration of the Services, such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.</p>
                <p>We use Administrator Data to complete the transactions you request, administer your account, improve the Services and detect and prevent fraud.</p>
                <p>We may contact you to provide information about new subscriptions, billing and important updates about the Services, including information about security or other technical issues. We may also contact you regarding third-party inquiries we receive regarding your use of the Services, as described in your customer agreement. You will not be able to unsubscribe from these communications. Subject to your contact preferences, you may also be contacted, by phone or e-mail, regarding information and offers about other products and services or to request your feedback.</p>
                <p>You may manage your contact preferences or update your information in your <a target="_self" class="mscom-link" href="https://account.windowsazure.cn/Home/Index">account profile</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Payment Data </strong></p>
                <p>When you make online purchases, you will be asked to provide information, which may include your payment instrument number (e.g., UnionPay or AliPay), your name and billing address, and the security code associated with your payment instrument and other financial data ("Payment Data").</p>
                <p>We use Payment Data to complete transactions, as well as for the detection and prevention of fraud.</p>
                <p>When you provide Payment Data while authenticated, we will store that data to help you complete future transactions without your having to provide the information again. We do not, however, retain the security code associated with your Payment instrument in this manner.</p>
                <p>To remove or modify Payment Data, please contact Customer Support. After you close your account or remove Payment Data, however, 21Vianet may retain your Payment Data for as long as reasonably necessary to complete your existing transaction and for the detection and prevention of fraud.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p><strong>Support Data</strong></p>
                <p>Support Data is the information we collect when you contact 21Vianet for help, including what you supply in a support request, results from running an automated troubleshooter, or files that you send us. Support data does not include administrator or payment data.</p>
