               <p>In today’s complex and regulated environment, businesses need to focus on building secure solutions in the cloud that deliver value to their customers, partners, and shareholders—rather than on the infrastructure to make it run. Cloud computing offers an opportunity to transfer some of the cost, risk, and effort of managing IT platforms and software to an independent, validated provider.
