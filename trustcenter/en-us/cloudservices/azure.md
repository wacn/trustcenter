                    <p>Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet is a separate instance of Microsoft's Azure cloud services located in mainland China and independently operated and sold by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of <a target="_self" href="http://www.ch.21vianet.com/">Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd</a>. It is based on the same Azure technology that powers Microsoft's global cloud services with comparable service levels to customers.</p>
                    <p>21Vianet understands that in order to realize the benefits of cloud computing you must be willing to trust your cloud provider with your Customer Data. When you invest in a cloud service, you must be able to trust that your Customer Data is safe, that data privacy is protected, and that you own and control your Customer Data in all its uses.</p>
                    <p>That’s why we strive to earn your trust in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet. Microsoft has broad experience developing enterprise online services, and has made major investments in foundational processes and technologies that build security and privacy into development. 21Vianet has also implemented industry-leading security measures and privacy policies, and participated in international and domestic compliance programs with independent verification of the Azure controls.</p>
                    <label style="color:rgb(0,115,198)">Security and privacy are embedded into the development of Azure</label>
                    <p>Security and privacy is made a priority at every step, from code development through incident response.</p>
                    <p>The design of Azure is dominated by security from the ground up. We build security into software code following an approach known as the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). Mandatory development process embeds security requirements into the entire software lifecycle, from planning through deployment. To help ensure that operational activities follow the same security priorities, we’ve developed rigorous security guidelines laid out in the Security Management process. </p>
                    <label style="color:rgb(0,115,198)">Security: We keep your Customer Data safe</label>
                    <p>Azure employs a robust set of security technologies and practices. These help ensure that Azure infrastructure is resilient to attack, safeguards user access to the Azure environment, and helps keep Customer Data secure through encrypted communications as well as threat management and mitigation practices, including regular penetration testing.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Manage and control identity and user access </strong>to your cloud environments, data, and applications by federating user identities to Azure Active Directory and enabling Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for more secure sign-in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encrypt communications and operation processes. </strong> For data in transit, Azure uses industry-standard transport protocols between user devices and Azure datacenters, and within datacenters themselves. For data at rest, Azure offers a wide range of encryption capabilities, giving you the flexibility to choose the solution that best meets your needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increase network security. </strong>Azure provides you the security-hardened infrastructure to connect virtual machines (VMs) to one another and to connect on-premises datacenters with Azure VMs. Azure blocks unauthorized traffic to and within datacenters, using a variety of technologies. Azure Virtual Networks extend your on-premises network to the cloud through IPsec-based site-to-site VPN technology or a high-speed Azure ExpressRoute dedicated WAN link.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defend against threats. </strong> Azure offers Microsoft Antimalware for Azure Cloud Services and Virtual Machines to help you protect against online threats. Azure also employs intrusion detection, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack prevention, regular penetration testing, and data analytics and machine learning tools to help mitigate threats to the Azure platform.</li>

Our approach to privacy and data protection is grounded in our commitment to organizations’ ownership of and control over the collection, use, and distribution of their Customer Data. We strive to be transparent in our privacy practices, offer you meaningful privacy choices, and responsibly manage the Customer Data we store and process. One measure of our commitment to data privacy is our adoption of the international and domestic standards of ISO 27001 and Information System Classified Security Protection (DJCP) with classification as Level 3.</p>

                            Azure meets international and industry-specific compliance standards, as well as country-specific standards. Rigorous third-party audits verify Azure’s adherence to standards-mandated security controls. As part of our commitment to transparency, you can verify our implementation of many security controls by requesting audit results from the certifying third parties. It makes it easier for you to validate compliance for the infrastructure and applications you run in Azure when 21Vianet verifies that our services meet compliance standards and when we demonstrate how we achieve compliance.

                    <p>In China, customers who use cloud services are subject to many different laws and regulations that may vary from location to location and industry to industry. To help our customers comply with their own requirements, we build our services with common privacy and security requirements in mind. However, it is ultimately up to our customers to evaluate our offerings against their own requirements, so they can determine if our services satisfy their regulatory needs. We are committed to providing our customers with detailed information about Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet to help them make their own regulatory assessments. </p>
                    <p>Trusted cloud services like Azure require shared responsibility between the customer and the service provider. 21Vianet is responsible for the services based on technology provided by Microsoft and seeks to provide cloud services that can meet the security, privacy, and compliance needs of our customers. Customers are responsible for their environment once the service has been provisioned, including their applications, data content, virtual machines, access credentials, and compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to their particular industry and locale.</p>
